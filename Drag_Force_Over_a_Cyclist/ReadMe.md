### Drag Force Analysis for a Cyclist

This Python program models the aerodynamic drag experienced by a cyclist under varying conditions.

**Tasks Performed:**
- Calculates drag force (`F_d = 0.5 * ρ * v² * A * C_d`) for a range of velocities.
- Analyzes variation of drag force with the **drag coefficient** (`C_d`).
- Generates and saves plots of:
  - Drag Force vs Velocity (parabolic relationship)
  - Drag Force vs Drag Coefficient (linear relationship)

**Inputs:**
- `C_d = 0.8`, `A = 0.1 m²`, `ρ = 1.2 kg/m³`

**Outputs:**
- `DFvsV.png`, `DFvsCd.png`
