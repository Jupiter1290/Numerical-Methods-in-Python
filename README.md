# Python for Mechanical Engineers

This repository contains Python programs developed as part of the course **“Python for Mechanical Engineers.”**  
Each folder corresponds to a separate engineering problem, focusing on the use of Python for numerical computation, data visualization, and mechanical system modelling.

## Repository Structure and Topics

| Folder | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `Curve_Fitting` | Fits temperature–specific heat data using linear, cubic, and biquadratic models; compares model accuracy via residuals. |
| `Data_Analysis` | Processes experimental engine data to estimate power output and specific fuel consumption using the trapezoidal rule. |
| `Drag_Force_Over_a_Cyclist` | Computes and visualizes aerodynamic drag variation with velocity and drag coefficient. |
| `Modelling_Otto_Cycle` | Models the ideal Otto cycle and generates the P–V diagram with calculated thermal efficiency. |
| `Modelling_a_Damped_Pendulumn` | Simulates damped pendulum motion by numerically solving nonlinear ODEs. |
| `NewtonRaphson_PressureInIceField` | Uses the Newton–Raphson method to find minimum cushion pressure in an ice field, analyzing relaxation factor effects. |
